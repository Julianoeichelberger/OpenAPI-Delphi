## What is OpenAPI-Delphi

**OpenAPI-Delphi** is an OpenAPI 3.0 generator for [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) that helps you to generate OpenAPI 3.0 documentation (in JSON) starting from plain Delphi classes. Delphi-OpenAPI uses the [Neon](https://github.com/paolo-rossi/delphi-neon) serialization library to transform the OpenAPI models from Delphi classes to JSON. Please take a look at the Demo to see OpenAPI-Delphi in action.

## General Features

- Use plain Delphi classes to set the OpenAPI specification fields
- Support for JSON Schema (the OpenAPI version)
- Use 1-line code (using the [Neon](https://github.com/paolo-rossi/delphi-neon) library) to transform into the JSON document
- Validation for the OpenAPI models (todo)

## TODO
- Better management of null objects (required by the OpenAPI specs)
